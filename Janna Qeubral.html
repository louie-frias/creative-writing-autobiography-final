            I cannot survive a day without Music. <br /><br />

            “Music is the only thing that is keeping me in sane.” Growing up, I have always been in love with Music, singing and listening to love songs. My mom and dad is the one who introduced me the music. My grandpa would often play songs very loud when I was little, causing my ears to hurt. So, I would constantly complain but, eventually, I just started to sing along with it. That is the time when I started to get into music, I cannot read yet during that time, but I can sing the song my grandpa would play like I am fluent in English, like word for word, I know it all. And ever since then, my love for music grew further and further. <br /><br />
            
            Being in my Elementary School days was fun, then I reached my High School era, but not long enough after being in my Grade 8, pandemic started. During those times, everyone are not allowed to go outside except for buying essentials though most of the time, people would just buy things online, all of us are big time sad, we had to think about the way we can entertain ourselves, each and everyone has their own ways like filming Tiktok videos, experimenting weird food combinations, doing work outs, making art works, and for some, playing online games kept them distracted. While me, on the other hand, got nothing to do at all, that made me straight up sad, I, for real, do not like the part of my time as I got no one to talk to, plus, I found out that our local church where I play instruments and sing praise and worship songs every Sunday is going to close temporarily due to COVID 19. <br /><br />
            
            I am truly miserable that time, well not the part where I would nonstop play music of course, that was the only thing that I would consider as ‘’my favorite part” since it is the only way I can prevent my self from over thinking things. By the time I woke up, the moment I opened my eyes, I would instantly search for my phone to play some music as I get up to make my bed, and that would continue, from eating my break fast, doing the dishes, finishing my modules, school related activities, cleaning the house, many more kinds of house chores, washing up, and to the end of the day before I sleep. Music helped me endure the boredom throughout the pandemic days, even after the restrictions were lifted up, I have never stopped loving music, my fondness for it only grew bigger, I even discovered many more music genres like K-Pop, I also began to stan a K-Pop group called BTS or 방탄소년단 which means “Bulletproof Boy  Scouts." They enlightened me that music can mean more, it is not only composed of tones and melodies, it can also express various of things such as love, your pain, one’s story, and many more. I did not know that music artists can be more than just lyricist, producers etc. <br /><br />
            
            I did not know that music and it's lyrics can save lives until I met them. Admiring this group taught me that your love for music can even break language barrier, they also advocate to love your self. I learned those from them, stanning them was like the best decision I have made. I am an avid fan of music, but the feels was never the same with BTS. I am over the moon every time I listen to their music. The feeling is too euphoric and ecstatic, it is like I can feel and really understand what they mean although I am not completely fluent to their language? I do not know a thing except the fact that I can relate to it. I truly believe that music is love, a friend, and a teacher. <br /><br />
            
            BTS and their music became a bridge that led me to experience more things like having great and strong bond with the music artist I listen to. I would never get used to it, really. In my own perspective, music is the best way to escape from reality, better than those addicting and illegal substances. Music is like a Tylenol that cures and takes every thing that pains me, So I say, why go to therapy sessions and services, when  listening to music alone can heal and drive your sorrows away for free?
